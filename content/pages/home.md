# Testimonials

> “As a therapist it is important to take care of yourself. This takes many forms: courses, supervisions, moments of well-being (ocean massage...). And also to grow through other therapists.
>
> Today I had the chance to have a second distance healing by a Usui Reiki Master and Kundalini Reiki practitioner. His name is Tiago Araújo.
>
> Being sensitive I felt a lot a big cleansing and regeneration, saw a lot of colors as I was listening the waves. And having a lot of insights. What a session! The way he works is full of sensitivity and professionalism and powerful!
> Highly recommended!
>
> In these times of crisis a remote treatment can really bring you more calm and serenity.”
