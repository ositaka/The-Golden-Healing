# About

The Golden Healing has the capacity to clean everything in our auric field, making changes to our celular structure to help to release old patterns and conditions. The golden healing light is the highest vibration of light that our bodies can receive and sustain, raising our frequency and dissolving blocks or foreign energies, to restore our bodies to their natural balance and harmony.

Golden healing help us to contact with spiritual worlds, accessing the super consciousness, as well as activating the Solar Plexus Chakra to join our will with Divine will.
Golden healing also aligns all of the chakras and balances yin/yang energies, helping us to understand where we need to make changes in our lives.

Golden healing accesses the Golden Ray, the highest vibration of light and can raise vibrations, intent, dissolved and releases blockages. This enhances joy, balances yin and yang energies and aligns all chakras. A multi-dimensional healing; cleaning and enhancing the organs, stimulating the immune system, bringing the body into balance and enhancing energy.
